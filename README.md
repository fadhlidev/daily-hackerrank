# Daily HackerRank Challenge Repository

Welcome to the **Daily HackerRank Challenge** repository! This repository is dedicated to my personal journey of solving HackerRank coding challenges daily. Here, you'll find my Java solutions to various HackerRank problems, each aimed at enhancing my problem-solving skills and mastering different algorithms and data structures.

## How to Use This Repository
- **Browse**: Explore the repository to find solutions for different HackerRank problems. Each topic (e.g., `warmup`, `implementation`) has its own folder, and each problem has a corresponding Java file (e.g., `AppleAndOrange.java`) with its solution.
- **Test**: For every solution I've provided, I've also created corresponding test files to ensure the correctness of the solutions. These test files are located in the `test` directory, mirroring the same folder structure as the `src` directory. You can find JUnit test classes for each problem, such as `AppleAndOrangeTest.java`, which test the solutions against various inputs and expected outputs.
- **Clone**: Clone the repository using the following command:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/fadhlidev/daily-hackerrank
    ```
- **Contribute**: Although this is a personal repository, feedback and suggestions are welcome. If you discover issues with solutions or have optimizations to suggest, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Disclaimer
Please note that the solutions provided here represent my interpretations of the HackerRank challenges. Different approaches may exist, and the solutions might not always be the most optimized or efficient. The primary goal is continuous learning and improvement.
